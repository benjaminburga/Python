#The code has been improved by adding the sys.exit() function to enable the user to exit the program at any time, a while loop to allow the user to play multiple times without restarting the program, the time.sleep(1) function to delay execution and enhance the user experience, and the option1 and option2 functions to break the code into different scenarios for improved clarity and understanding.
